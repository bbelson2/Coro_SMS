  abstract  = {Kahn andMacQueen have introduced a generic class of determinate asynchronous data-flow applications, called Kahn Process Networks (KPNs) with an elegant mathematical model and semantics in terms of Scott-continuous functions on data streams together with an implementation model of independent asynchronous sequential programs communicating through FIFO buffers with blocking read and non-blocking write operations. The two are related by the Kahn Principle which states that a realization according to the implementationmodel behaves as predicted by the mathematical function. Additional steps are required to arrive at an actual implementation of a KPN to take care of scheduling of independent processes on a single processor and to manage communication buffers. Because of the expressiveness of the KPN model, buffer sizes and schedules cannot be determined at design time in general and require dynamic run-time system support. Constraints are discussed that need to be placed on such system support so as to maintain the Kahn Principle. We then discuss a possible extension of the KPN model to include the possibility for sporadic, reactive behavior which is not possible in the standard model. The extended model is called Reactive Process Networks. We introduce its semantics, look at analyzability and at more constrained data-flowmodels combined with reactive behavior.},

Compared to the standard exhaustive search technique, our improved approach is more efficient both asymptotically and practically. We implemented several optimized versions of our techniques on CPUs and GPUs. Our technique runs more than 10 times faster on modern graphic cards than on the most powerful CPU available. Today, we can solve 48+ quadratic equations in 48 binary variables on a 500-dollar NVIDIA GTX 295 graphics card in 21 minutes. With this level of performance, solving systems of equations supposed to ensure a security level of 64 bits turns out to be feasible in practice with a modest budget. This is a clear demonstration of the computational power of GPUs in solving many types of combinatorial and cryptanalytic problems.},

To address this difficulty, many game-oriented scripting languages have been proposed so far. However, current scripting languages seem to lack support for interactions among multiple concurrent activities in a state-dependent manner. To overcome this problem, we propose an event handling framework called ``join token'' in which the states of game characters can be expressed as tokens and interactions can be described as handlers specifying multiple tokens. For the purpose of evaluation, we have developed a game scripting language called ``Mogemoge,'' and wrote several sample games in this language. In this paper, we describe experiences of using join token framework for sample games and compare the code written in Mogemoge against a code written in an existing scripting language.},

  abstract = {Formal scenarios have many uses in requirements engineering, validation, performance modeling, and test generation. Many tools and methodologies can handle scenarios when the number of steps (interleaved inputs and outputs of the target system) is reasonably small. However, scenario based techniques do not scale well with the number of steps, number of actors, and complexity of behaviors and system interactions to be specified in the scenario. First, it is impractically tedious and error-prone to specify thousands of input steps and corresponding expected outputs. Second, even if one can write down such large scale scenarios, confidence in their correctness is naturally low. Third, complex systems requiring large scale scenarios tend to require many such scenarios to adequately cover the behavior space. This paper describes the motivations for and problems of large scale scenarios, as well as the LSS method, which uses automated and semi-automated techniques in describing, maintaining, communicating, and using large scale scenarios in requirements engineering. The method is illustrated in two widely divergent application domains: military live training instrumentation and electronic mail servers. A case study demonstrates the practical and beneficial use of LSS in architectural modeling of a complex, real-world system design.},

  abstract  = {Sensor networks can consist of large number of sensors. Often, sensors networks use low cost units and thus a subject to malfunctions that can bring the system to inconsistent states. After deployment, the system can be situated in places that are hard to reach and therefore manual reboot operations are undesirable and even unfeasible. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the eventual recovery of arbitrary fault when designing sensor networks. Dijkstra's algorithm is an important foundation of self-managing computer system and fault-tolerance computing system in distributed systems, since it allows a distributed system to recover from arbitrary starting state within a finite time. The arbitrary starting state ca model arbitrary failure (as long as the code segment stays correct). Another key advantage of Dijkstra's asynchronous algorithm is that no global clock is needed. This project tests an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm using snapshotting techniques that we developed in an earlier work. These sensors can initiate from any state but they come into a consistent one after several cycles of running. We demonstrate the usefulness of our testing technique.},

  abstract  = {Writing applications that connect to external services and yet remain responsive and resource conscious is a difficult task. With the rise of web programming this has become a common problem. The solution lies in using asynchronous operations that separate issuing a request from waiting for its completion. However, doing so in common object-oriented languages is difficult and error prone. Asynchronous operations rely on callbacks, forcing the programmer to cede control. This inversion of control-flow impedes the use of structured control constructs, the staple of sequential code. In this paper, we describe the language support for asynchronous programming in the upcoming version of C                                                                          {\$}^{\backslash}sharp{\$}                .

Hardware-dependent code and the use of locks to protect shared data structures from simultaneous access lead to poor portability, the difficulty to prove correctness, and a myriad of problems associated with locking such as limiting the available parallelism, deadlocks, starvation, interrupt handling, and so on. In this work we explore what can be achieved in terms of portability and simplicity in an SMP scheduler that achieves similar performance to state-of-the-art schedulers. By strictly limiting ourselves to only lock-free data structures in the scheduler, the problems associated with locking vanish altogether. We show that by employing implicit cooperative scheduling, additional guarantees can be made that allow novel and very efficient implementations of memory-efficient unbounded lock-free queues. Cooperative multitasking has the additional benefit that it provides an extensive hardware independence. It even allows the scheduler to be used as a runtime library for applications running on top of standard operating systems. In a comparison against Windows Server and Linux running on up to 64 cores we analyze the performance of the lock-free scheduler and show that it matches or even outperforms the performance of these two state-of-the-art schedulers in a variety of benchmarks.},

We show how some of Hip/Sleek features such as user-defined predicates and lemmas make the specifications highly expressive and the verification process viable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first code-level verification of memory safety and functional correctness properties of the FreeRTOS scheduler. The outcome of our experiment confirms that Hip/Sleek can indeed be used to verify code that is used in production. Moreover, since the properties that we verify are quite general, we envisage that the same approach can be adopted to verify components of other operating systems.},

Due to energy limitations and high energy costs of communication, in-network processing has been proposed as a means to reduce data transfers. As application demands may change over time and nodes run low on energy, get overloaded, or simply face debasing communication capabilities, runtime adaptation is required. In either case, it is useful to be able to migrate computations between neighboring nodes without losing runtime state that might be costly or even impossible to recompute. We propose stateful mobile modules as a basic infrastructure building block to improve adaptiveness and robustness of in-network processing applications. Stateful mobile modules are binary modules linked on the node itself. Even more importantly, they can be transparently migrated from one node to another, thereby keeping statically as well as dynamically allocated memory. This is achieved by an optimized binary format, a memory-efficient linking process and an advanced programming support.},

Despite, or even because, of the long history of theory and practice in this field, adapting existing systems to environments of different conditions and requirements as originally specified or assumed, in terms of functional and/or non-functional respects, is anything but simple. Especially this is true for the embedded systems domain which, on the one hand, calls for highly specialized and application-aware system abstractions and, on the other hand, cares a great deal for easily reusable implementations of these abstractions. The latter aspect becomes more and more important as embedded systems technology is faced with an innovation cycle decreasing in length. Software for embedded systems needs to be designed for variability, and this is in particular true for the operating systems of this domain. The paper discusses dimensions of variability that need to be considered in the development of embedded operating systems and presents approaches that aid construction and maintenance of evolutionary operating systems.},

The proposed methodology consists of five different abstract levels: Simulink combined algorithm and architecture model (CAAM), virtual architecture (VA), transactional accurate architecture (TA), virtual prototype (VP) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) emulation. Experimental results of Motion-JPEG and H.264 show that the proposed gradual refinement flow can generate various MPSoC architectures from an original Simulink model, allowing processor, communication and tasks design space exploration.},

Borrowing the synchronous reactive model of Esterel, HipHop is based on synchronous concurrency and preemption primitives that are known to be key components for the modular design of complex reactive behaviors. HipHop departs from Esterel by its ability to handle the dynamicity of Web applications, thanks to the reflexivity of Hop. Using a music player example, we show how to modularly build a non-trivial Hop application using HipHop orchestration code.},

  abstract = {Application developers utilizing event-based middleware have sought to leverage domain-specific modeling for the advantages of intuitive specification, code synthesis, and support for design evolution. For legacy and cyber-physical systems, the use of event-based middleware may mean that changes in computational platform can result anomalous system behavior, due to the presence of implicit temporal dependencies. These anomalies are a function not of the component implementation, but of the model of computation employed for supporting system composition. In order to address these behavioral anomalies, the paper presents an approach where time-based blocks are inserted into the system to account for the temporal dependencies. An advantage of capturing the system composition in a domain-specific modeling language is the ability to efficiently refactor an application to include time-triggered, event-based schedulers. This paper describes how an existing event-based component topology can be modified to permit a time-triggered model of computation, with no changes to the existing component software. Further, the time-triggered components can be deployed alongside standard publish/subscribe methodologies. This strategy is beneficial to the maintenance of existing legacy systems upon upgrade, since the current operational mode could be maintained with minimal changes to the legacy software even under changes to the target platform which alter execution speed. These time-triggered layers are discussed in three permutations: fully triggered, start triggered, and release triggered. A discussion is provided regarding the limitations of each approach, and a brief example is given. The example shows how to apply these triggering approaches without the modification of existing components, but instead through the insertion of triggered buffers between legacy components.},

An SRO is implemented and used much like an ordinary .NET object and can expose arbitrary user-defined APIs, but it is aggressive about automatically exploiting multicore CPUs. It does so by spontaneously and transparently partitioning its state into a set of replicas that handle method calls in parallel and automatically merging replicas before processing calls that cannot execute in the replicated state. Developers need not be concerned about protecting access to shared data; each replica is a monitor and has its own state. The runtime ensures proper synchronization, scheduling, decides when to split/merge, and can transparently migrate replicas to other processes to decrease contention. Compared to threads/locks or toolkits such as .NET Parallel Extensions, SROs offer a simpler, more versatile programming model while delivering comparable, and in some cases even higher performance.},

  abstract = {In recent years embedded systems have entered the multicore era. As the number of cores keeps growing in embedded systems, it becomes more important to provide programming support which considers embedded system constraints and in the meanwhile helps utilize multicore systems. So far though C still dominates embedded programming, C++ is gaining in importance in parallel programming. It is promising to support C++ for embedded multicore systems. However, embedded systems usually have tight resource budgets, and C++ is commonly considered having huge code size that embedded systems can not afford. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the code size requirement of a C++ library and propose a layered design to provide a code size aware library support. On the other hand, to utilize embedded multicore systems, we employ C++ linguistic features to facilitate embedded multicore programming. With C++, we incorporate high-level abstractions and design patterns into the programming support to enhance low-level programming APIs that can be used to exploit DSPs, SIMD instructions, and DMAs on embedded multicore systems. At last, we evaluate our C++ support with a Blur and a JPEG program. Our result on a dual-DSP platform shows that we can obtain speedups of 3.32 and 3.09 for the Blur and JPEG program, respectively.},

One way to deal with a diversity of requirements is to create flexible modeling frameworks that can be adapted to cover the field of interest. The downside of this approach is a weakening of the semantics of the modeling frameworks that compromises interoperability, understandability, and analyzability of the models. An alternative approach is to embrace heterogeneity and to provide mechanisms for a diversity of models to interact. This paper reviews an approach that achieves such interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. An example of such an abstract semantics is the actor semantics, which can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today. The actor abstract semantics and many concrete semantics have been implemented in Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework distributed under a BSD-style license.},

  abstract = {Scheduling concerns the allocation of processors to processes, and is traditionally associated with low-level tasks in operating systems and embedded devices. However, modern software applications with soft real-time requirements need to control application-level performance. High-level scheduling control at the application level may complement general purpose OS level scheduling to fine-tune performance of a specific application, by allowing the application to adapt to changes in client traffic on the one hand and to low-level scheduling on the other hand. This paper presents an approach to express and analyze application-specific scheduling decisions during the software design stage. For this purpose, we integrate support for application-level scheduling control in a high-level object-oriented modeling language, Real-Time ABS, in which executable specifications of method calls are given deadlines and real-time computational constraints. In Real-Time ABS, flexible application-specific schedulers may be specified by the user, i.e., developer, at the abstraction level of the high-level modeling language itself and associated with concurrent objects at creation time. Tool support for Real-Time ABS is based on an abstract interpreter that supports simulations and measurements of systems at the design stage.},

But the diversity of applications with typically narrow node resources and requirements of already existing information infrastructures sets hard constraints to WSN. The software development process becomes even more complicated when real-time constraints have to be taken into account. This is the case when the physical processes of the WSN environment have to be observed and are realized in space and time. For the development of such WSN we present a model-based framework (GAF4WSN), where the well-known techniques SDL, UML and ASN.1 are involved. The framework was already successfully used for the development of a new generation of Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS). An Earthquake Synthesizer (ES) and an Experiment Management System (EMS) complete the framework, which supports the modelling, simulation, installation and administration of different EEWS approaches in combination with a Geographic Information System (GIS).},

  abstract = {The daily life of people with severe motor system impairments is challenging and thus often subordinated to extensive external help; increasing their level of self-support is thus highly desirable. Recent advances in wireless communications, in particular in wireless personal-area networks, serve as technological enablers well suited for implementing smart and convenient assistive environments which can increase self-support. This paper presents the design and prototyping of a versatile interface for such wireless assistive environments. We propose a modular framework that can accommodate several wireless personal-area network standards. The interface is built upon this framework and is designed in such a way that it can be controlled by various types of input devices such as a touch screen or a tongue-control unit. The interface can automatically discover consumer appliances (e.g. Zigbee and Bluetooth enabled lights and computers) in the user's environment and display the services supported by these devices on a user-friendly graphical user interface. A demonstrator is prototyped and experimental results show that the proposed interface is context-aware, i.e. it successfully detects available appliances, adapts itself to the changes that occur in the user's environment, and automatically informs the user about these changes. The results also show that the proposed interface is versatile and easy to use, i.e. the user can easily control multiple devices by means of a browser menu. Hence, the proposed work illustrates how assistive technology based on wireless personal-area networks can contribute to improving the quality of life of motor system impaired persons.},

The formal semantics is given by mapping UML-RT models into a language called kiltera, a real-time extension of the                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}                                                            $\pi$                                                      -calculus. Previous attempts to formalize the semantics of UML-RT have fallen short by considering only a very small subset of the language and providing fundamentally incomplete semantics based on incorrect assumptions, such as a one-to-one correspondence between ``capsules'' and threads. Our semantics is novel in several ways: (1) it deals with both state machine diagrams and capsule diagrams; (2) it deals with aspects of UML-RT that have not been formalized before, such as thread allocation, service provision points, and service access points; (3) it supports an action language; and (4) the translation has been implemented in the form of a transformation from UML-RT models created with IBM's RSA-RTE tool, into kiltera code. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive formal semantics for UML-RT to date.},

This formalism characterizes atomic elements with control behavior as Continuation Actors, giving them a static semantics with a functional interface. Coroutine Models are then defined as networks of Continuation Actors, representing a set of control locations between which control traverses during execution. This paper gives both a strict and non-strict denotational semantics for Coroutine Models in terms of compositions of Continuation Actors and their interfaces. In the strict form, the traversal of control locations forms a control path producing output values, whereas in the non-strict form, execution traverses a tree of potential control locations producing partial information about output values. Furthermore, the given non-strict form of these semantics is claimed to have useful monotonicity properties.},

  abstract  = {A major and so far unmet challenge in software engineering is to achieve and act upon a clear and sound understanding of the relationship between formalism and intuition in the development process. The challenge is salient in the development of cyber-physical systems, in which the computer interacts with the human and physical world to ensure a behaviour there that satisfies the requirements of the system's stakeholders. The nature of the computer as a formally defined symbol-processing engine invites a formal mathematical approach to software development. Contrary considerations militate against excessive reliance on formalism. The non-formal nature of the human and physical world, the complexity of system function, and the need for human comprehension at every level demand application of non-formal and intuitional knowledge, of insight and technique rather than calculation. The challenge, then, is to determine how these two facets of the development process---formalism and intuition---can work together most productively. This short essay describes some origins and aspects of the challenge and offers a perspective for addressing it.},

The embedding of our actor-based Java API is shallow in the sense that it abstracts from the actual thread-based deployment models. We further discuss different concurrent execution and thread-based deployment models and an extension of the API for its actual parallel and distributed implementation. We present briefly the results of a set of experiments which provide evidence of the potential impact of lambda expressions in Java 8 regarding the adoption of the actor concurrency model in large-scale distributed applications.},

Third, the ADG is subsequently partitioned into of sub-graphs where cuts can be made horizontal (for a pipelined execution) or vertical (for a concurrent execution). Finally, we generate for each sub-graph a corresponding component and automatically synthesize a communication infrastructure between these components.},

  abstract = {A key issue in the development of reliable embedded software is the proper handling of reactive control-flow, which typically involves concurrency. Java and its thread concept have only limited provisions for implementing deterministic concurrency. Thus, as has been observed in the past, it is challenging to develop concurrent Java programs without any deadlocks or race conditions. To alleviate this situation, the Light-weight Synchronous Java (SJL) approach presented here adopts the key concepts that have been established in the world of synchronous programming for handling reactive control-flow. Thus SJL not only provides deterministic concurrency, but also different variants of deterministic preemption. Furthermore SJL allows concurrent threads to communicate with Esterel-style signals. As a case study for an embedded system usage, we also report on how the SJL concepts have been ported to the ARM-based Lego Mindstorms NXT system. We evaluated the SJL approach to be efficient and provide experimental results comparing it to Java threads.},

  abstract = {Today middleware is much more powerful, more reliable and faster than it used to be. Nevertheless, for the application developer, the complexity of using middleware platforms has increased accordingly. The volume and variety of application contexts that current middleware technologies have to support require that developers be able to anticipate the widest possible range of execution environments, desired and undesired effects of different programming strategies, handling procedures for runtime errors, and so on. This paper shows how a generic framework designed to evaluate the usability of notations (the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations Framework, or CDN) has been instantiated and used to analyze the cognitive challenges involved in adapting middleware platforms. This human-centric perspective allowed us to achieve novel results compared to existing middleware evaluation research, typically centered around system performance metrics. The focus of our study is on the process of adapting middleware implementations, rather than in the end product of this activity. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we describe a qualitative CDN-based method to analyze the cognitive effort made by programmers while adapting middleware implementations. And second, we show how two platforms designed for flexibility have been compared, suggesting that certain programming language design features might be particularly helpful for developers.},

A player moves in the plane with unit speed, emptying the cups. At any time, the player sees how much water there is in every cup. The player has no information on how the water will be poured into the cups in the future; in particular, the pouring may depend on the player's motion. The backlog of the player is the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time, and the player's objective is to minimise the backlog. Let D be the diameter of P. If the water is poured at the rate of 1/2 into the cups at the ends of a diameter, the backlog is $\Omega$(D). We show that there is a strategy for the player that guarantees the backlog of O(D), matching the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant. Note that our guarantee is independent of the number of the cups.},

  abstract = {Emerging embedded systems require heterogeneous multiprocessor SoC architectures that can satisfy both high-performance and programmability. However, as the complexity of embedded systems increases, software programming on an increasing number of multiprocessors faces several critical problems, such as multithreaded code generation, heterogeneous architecture adaptation, short design time, and low cost implementation. In this paper, we present a software code generation flow based on Simulink to address these problems. We propose a functional modeling style to capture data-intensive and control-dependent target applications, and a system architecture modeling style to seamlessly transform the functional model into the target architecture. Both models are described using Simulink. From a system architecture Simulink model, a code generator produces a multithreaded code, inserting thread and communication primitives to abstract the heterogeneity of the target architecture. In addition, the multithread code generator called LESCEA applies the extensions of dataflow based memory optimization techniques, considering both data and control dependency. Experimental results on a Motion-JPEG decoder and an H.264 decoder show that the proposed multithread code generator enables easy software programming on different multiprocessor architectures with substantially reduced data memory size (up to 68.0{\%}) and code memory size (up to 15.9{\%}).},

The distinguishing features of Rialto and its implementation are 1) A formal semantics: the language is formalized using SOS (structured operational semantics) rules; 2) Encapsulation of models of computation into policies: we thus distinguish between the syntactic elements of the language (parallelism, interrupts) and its semantics; 3) efficient implementation algorithms. Policies are expressed in the language itself, which allows for more expressive power and a sounder semantics.},

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an example of distributed computing on low resources devices. WSNs encountered a considerable success in many application areas. Due to the constraints related to the small sensor nodes capabilities, distributed computing in WSNs allows to perform complex tasks in a collaborative way, reducing power consumption and increasing battery life. Many hardware platforms compose the ecosystem of WSNs and some lightweight operating systems have also been designed to ease application deployment, to ensure efficient resources management, and to decrease energy consumption. In this chapter we focus on distributed computing from several points of view emphasizing important aspects, ranging from hardware platforms to applications on resource constrained devices.},

  abstract = {The synchronous model of concurrent computation (SMoCC) is well established for programming languages in the domain of safety-critical reactive and embedded systems. Translated into mainstream C/Java programming, the SMoCC corresponds to a cyclic execution model in which concurrent threads are synchronised on a logical clock that cuts system computation into a sequence of macro-steps. A causality analysis verifies the existence of a schedule on memory accesses to ensure each macro-step is deadlock-free and determinate. We introduce an abstract semantic domain                                                                           {\$}{\$}I({\backslash}mathbb {\{}D{\}}, {\backslash}mathbb {\{}P{\}}){\$}{\$}                                                                                    I                        (                        D                        ,                        P                        )                                                                             and an associated denotational fixed-point semantics for reasoning about concurrent and sequential variable accesses within a synchronous cycle-based model of computation.

Based on this fixed-point semantics we propose the notion of Input Berry-constructiveness (IBC) for synchronous programs. This new IBC class lies properly between strong (SBC) and normal Berry-constructiveness (BC) defined in previous work. SBC and BC are two ways to interpret the standard constructive semantics of synchronous programming, as exemplified by imperative SMoCC languages such as Esterel or Quartz. SBC is often too restrictive as it requires all variables to be initialised by the program. BC can be too permissive because it initialises all variables to a fixed value, by default. Where the initialisation happens through the memory, e.g., when carrying values from one synchronous tick to the next, then IBC is more appropriate. IBC links two levels of execution, the macro-step level and the micro-step level. We prove that the denotational fixed-point analysis for IBC, and hence Berry's causality analysis, is sound with respect to operational micro-level scheduling. The denotational model can thus be viewed as a compositional presentation of a synchronous scheduling strategy that ensures reactiveness and determinacy for imperative concurrent programming.},

  abstract = {The importance of data science and big data analytics is growing very fast as organizations are gearing up to leverage their information assets to gain competitive advantage. The flexibility offered through big data analytics empowers functional as well as firm-level performance. In the first phase of the study, we attempt to analyze the research on big data published in high-quality business management journals. The analysis was visualized using tools for big data and text mining to understand the dominant themes and how they are connected. Subsequently, an industry-specific categorization of the studies was done to understand the key use cases. It was found that most of the existing research focuses majorly on consumer discretionary, followed by public administration. Methodologically, a major focus in such exploration is in social media analytics, text mining and machine learning applications for meeting objectives in marketing and supply chain management. However, it was found that not much focus was highlighted in these studies to demonstrate the tools used for the analysis. To address this gap, this study also discusses the evolution, types and usage of big data tools. The brief overview of big data technologies grouped by the services they enable and some of their applications are presented. The study categorizes these tools into big data analysis platforms, databases and data warehouses, programming languages, search tools, and data aggregation and transfer tools. Finally, based on the review, future directions for exploration in big data has been provided for academic and practice.              },

  abstract  = {All compilers and many run-time systems use dynamically sized data. The size of such data is not known in advance and room for it must be found at run time. Examples inside the compiler are symbol tables, strings from the source program, ASTs, register interference graphs for graph coloring, and many others. The examples in run-time systems derive from the nature of the source language: strings, dynamically sized arrays in imperative languages, closures in functional languages, tentative unifications in logic languages, and incoming messages in distributed languages are a few that come to mind.},

  abstract  = {In this chapter we introduce the foundations for the programming models we consider most suitable for programming many-core chips: communicating sequential processes (CSP), the Actor model and the task based model. For each of these, we shortly survey and compare the most commonly available programming language implementations: the goal is to lay the groundwork for the more in-depth analysis and presentation in the next chapter. An important part of the chapter will deal with the comparative analysis of thread/process based and task based parallelism, as well as an analysis of shared memory based models.},
