abstract={In this paper we describe our experiences using a wireless sensor network to monitor the coal mines with sensors. Wireless networks that link sensors have the potential to greatly benefit for monitoring of coal mine conditions and localization of miners. Substituting light, small wireless sensor network nodes for traditional wired, heavy and fixed monitoring equipment leads to faster, easier and larger-scale deployments in complicated environment. Network consisted of many wireless sensor nodes is now feasible in practice. The primary problem of designing a wireless sensor network for coal mine monitoring and localization of miners is the high system reliability and robustness demanded by its application and safety. The topology of sensor networks is also a main factor we have to take into account. The sensor network application we designed for coal mine monitoring bases on Berkeley TinyOS and Motes platform. We evaluate this design and gain some useful experiences which will benefit our subsequent work.},

abstract={Stream processing has been shown to be a computing paradigm that is well suited to the distributed processing of massive amounts of continuous real-time data. In stream processing, tasks are distributed across processing nodes and the information flow passes from task to task. The allocation of tasks to nodes has typically been carried out by a centralized task manager. Whilst this allocation approach has allowed optimization of the task allocation for constrained domains, it is likely to suffer problems as the complexity of the processing tasks and the scale of the network rise and the network becomes more dynamic. In this paper we explore the potential for a distributed autonomous task allocation based on an embryonic approach combined with a node differentiation that uses reaction-diffusion techniques. In this approach each processing node contains a full description of the processing tasks, and determines its own optimal role based on interactions with its neighbors. We describe the approach and provide preliminary results that indicate that it is likely to provide elegant scalability and therefore warrants further consideration.},

abstract={Nowadays, embedded systems have a huge amount of computational power and consequently, high complexity. It is quite usual to find different applications being executed in embedded systems. Embedded system design demands for method and tools that allow the simulation and verification in an efficient and practical way. This paper proposes the development and evaluation of a solution for embedded modeling and simulation of heterogeneous Models of Computation (MoCs) in a distributed way by the integration of Ptolemy II and the High Level Architecture (HLA), a middleware for distributed discrete event simulation, in order to create an environment with high-performance execution of large-scale heterogeneous models. Experimental results demonstrate, that the use of a non distributed simulation for some situations can be infeasible, as well as the use of distributed simulation with few machines, like one, two or three computers. It was demonstrated that a speedup of factor 4 was acquired when a model with 4,000 thousands actors were distributed in 8 different machines.},

In Edupar'2012, we proposed a course with a novel approach, using a wireless sensor network environment to pin all topics down to concrete applications and to maintain issues such as fault tolerance and coordination continuously present. The second initiative is a smaller one, in which we insert a new topic in a Systems Software course to allow students to have a better understanding of what is application-level multitasking and of how it can be implemented. In this paper, we report on the experience of teaching the proposed syllabus and the adjustments that were necessary. We also discuss some plans for the courses in 2013.},

year={2015}, 
pages={1175-1180}, 
abstract={Smartphones have become popular mainly because of the large variety of applications they can run. In contrast, most devices in the phone's environment - e.g., household appliances or environmental sensors - are much less flexible because their functionality is hardcoded at the design time. In order to realize the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), where all devices communicate with each other to realize joint tasks, it is necessary that these devices are able to extend and adapt their functionalities on-the-fly based on their surrounding. To realize smart functionalities for IoT devices, we propose "hybrid Apps", the concept of Smartphone "Apps" applied to small embedded systems. In contrast with current packaged "smart home" solutions, where all appliances have to be changed to their smart counterparts at the same time, hybrid Apps permit an incremental and hence feasible deployment of the IoT vision. In this paper we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach. We argue code interpretation as a candidate reprogramming method for IoT devices and analyzed its feasibility with real-world measurements of key parameters such as computational and energy overhead. While in general, code interpretation incurs a large energy-overhead, we show that for typical IoT applications executed every few seconds, it is as low as 1%.},

abstract={Interoperability is one of the key requirements in the Internet of Things considering the diverse platforms, communication standards and specifications available today. Inherent resource constraints in the majority of IoT devices makes it very difficult to use existing solutions for interoperability, thus demanding new approaches. This paper presents the process of adapting a lightweight interoperability middleware for IoT, LISA, from RIOT to Contiki OS and evaluates memory and power overheads. The middleware follows a service oriented architecture and classifies devices according to available resources to assign different roles, such as Application, Service and Manager Nodes. These roles live in different tiers in a generic IoT architecture, where the Manager nodes are located in the intermediate Fog layer. To adapt to an event based kernel of Contiki, the middleware defines and handles a set of events that are used to communicate with the user application. A network of nodes is simulated to show the architecture promoted by the middleware and the results are presented.},

abstract={Wearable sensors are widely used for data collection in many applications. Ssensor nodes have also been applied for real-time applications, e.g. for ECG analysis or activity and fall detection. Processing of the sensor data is either done on an external device or on the node itself. While on-node processing reduces data rate and increases battery life, development and testing can be time-consuming. To allow faster implementation of such algorithms, we propose a simulation framework for the Shimmer platform using the Cooja simulator, MSPSim and the Contiki operating system. We provide the simulator and example applications compatible with the ShimmerConnect protocol, allowing streaming of raw and pre-processed sensor data to MATLAB, LabView and Android. Additionally, a simple activity and fall detection algorithm was implemented on the sensor node and evaluated using both the simulator and real hardware. In the future this will allow rapid development and testing of on-node pre-processing algorithms.},

abstract={This paper introduces a method for selectively pre-processing and recording sensor data for engineering testing purposes in vehicles. In order to condense data, methodologies from the domain of sensor networks and stream processing are applied, which results in a reduction of the quantity of data, while maintaining information quality. A situation-dependent modification of recording parameters allows for a detailed profiling of vehicle-related errors. We developed a data-flow oriented model, in which data streams are connected by processing nodes. These nodes filter and aggregate the data and can be connected in nearly any order, which permits a successive composition of the aggregation and recording strategy. The integration with an event-condition-action model provides adaptability of the processing and recording, depending on the state of the vehicle. In a proof-of-concept system, which we implemented on top of the automotive diagnostic protocols KWP and UDS, the feasibility of the approach was shown. The target platform was an embedded on-board computer that is connected to the OBD-II interface of the vehicle. As the scope of recording can be adjusted flexibly, the recording system can not only be used for diagnostic purposes, but also serves objectives in development, quality assurance, and even marketing.},

Various research issues related with sensor networks are intensively proposed, and they are evaluated by some network simulators or real sensor platforms.

Although TOSSIM's architecture and interfaces are well designed for wireless sensor networks based on IEEE 802.15.4 standards, its current RF model is too simple to support main features of the PHY stack of the IEEE 802.15.4. In order to enhance the accuracy of wireless simulation results and implement IEEE 802.15.4 standard, we design a new wireless propagation model and RF physical stack based on the two-ray ground path loss model and CC2420 RF transceiver.

It is now widely used in modern robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, due in part to its low-cost, ease of programming, and rapid prototyping capabilities. Sensors and actuators can easily be connected to the analog and digital I/O pins of an Arduino device, which features an on-board microcontroller programmed using the Arduino API. The increasing complexity of physical computing applications has now led to a series of Arduino-compatible devices with faster processors, increased flash storage, larger memories and more complicated I/O architectures. The Intel Galileo, for example, is designed to support the Arduino API on top of a Linux system, code-named Clanton. However, the standard API is restricted to the capabilities found on less powerful devices, lacking support for multithreaded programs, or specification of real-time requirements. In this paper, we present Qduino, a system developed for Arduino compatible boards. Qduino provides an extended Arduino API which, while backward-compatible with the original API, supports real-time multithreaded sketches and event handling. Experiments show the performance gains of Qduino compared to Clanton Linux.},

abstract={Graph matching is a fundamental graph theory problem which has a broad application range including information retrieval, pattern recognition, graph partitioning, chemical structure analysis, protein function prediction, backup placement and cellular coverage. This problem has gained attention in distributed computing as there are distributed matching algorithms with asymptotically guaranteed time bounds and approximation ratios. On the other side, we do not know the practical performance of these algorithms. In this paper, we provide a detailed performance evaluation of asynchronous distributed maximum weighted matching (MWM) algorithms. We assume a message-passing system in CONGEST model in which the message size is limited to O(log n) where n is the number of nodes. This model is popular for energy-efficient networks such as wireless sensor networks. We used a discrete event simulator, SimPy, to model the assumed network structures. We provide the implementations of Watthenhofer and Wattenhofer's algorithm, Hoepman's algorithm, Lotker et al.'s algorithm and Lotker et al.'s improvement algorithm. The results show that the greedy algorithm of Hoepman performed best in approximating the optimum result in all types of networks, even achieving an approximation ratio of 0.99 in some instances. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study which provides an extensive performance evaluation of distributed MWM algorithms.},

We present the design of a new hardware and software platform that addresses these shortcomings by bringing together Mobile, Wearable, Maker and Wireless Sensor Network technologies to enable rapid prototyping with a high degree of synergy and energy efficiency. This is achieved in part by leveraging the Memory Protection Unit on modern microcontrollers along with a novel syscall interface to provide kernel / user isolation and a clean concurrency model. Such a design allows a wide range of languages to be used for application development without significant adaptation. We demonstrate how careful choice of application language allows the naturally asynchronous nature of embedded programming to be expressed cleanly and powerfully. Finally we evaluate the platform in several integrated use cases, providing examples of the capabilities introduced by Synergy.},

Traditionally, sensor network research has been to be unlike the internet, motivated by power and device constraints. The IETF 6LoWPAN draft standard changes this, defining how IPv6 packets can be efficiently transmitted over IEEE 802.15.4 radio links. Due to this 6LoWPAN technology, low power, low cost microcontrollers can be connected to the internet forming what is known as the Wireless embedded Internet. Another IETF recommendation, CoAP allows these devices to communicate interactively over the Internet. The integration of such tiny, ubiquitous electronic devices to the Internet enables interesting real-time applications.

We then used this scheduler to implement RPC-like interfaces that capture different communication patterns common in wireless sensor networks. This allows the programmer to work, when appropriate, with a synchronous style, while maintaining an asynchronous model at the message exchange level.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks necessitate a programming model different from those used to develop desktop applications. Typically, resources in terms of power and memory are constrained. C is the most common programming language used to develop applications on very small embedded sensor devices. We claim that C does not provide efficient mechanisms to address the implicit asynchronous nature of sensor sampling. C applications for these devices suffer from a disruption in their control flow. In this paper, we present FlowTalk, a new object-oriented programming language aimed at making software development for wireless embedded sensor devices easier. FlowTalk is an object-oriented programming language in which dynamicity (e.g., object creation) has been traded for a reduction in memory consumption. The event model that traditionally comes from using sensors is adapted in FlowTalk with controlled disruption, a light-weight continuation mechanism. The essence of our model is to turn asynchronous long-latency operations into synchronous and blocking method calls. FlowTalk is built for TinyOS and can be used to develop applications that can fit in 4 KB of memory for a large number of wireless sensor devices.},

pages={110-119}, 
abstract={We address the problem of providing users, namely non specialists, with out-of-the-box, programmable, Wireless Sensor-Actuator Networks (WSN). The idea is that users get a package containing a gateway and an undetermined number of nodes, pre-configured to work as a self-organized wireless mesh. Each node comes with two pre-installed components: a small operating system and a virtual machine. The user can then use a simple, domain-specific, programming language to implement periodic tasks that are compiled into byte-code, and can be sent to the nodes for execution. At the nodes, the operating system manages a task table and schedules non-preemptive tasks for execution using the virtual machine. No subtle hardware or software configuration is required from the user as these details are abstracted away by the virtual machine. We developed a full specification for a data-layer that follows the aforementioned guidelines and implemented a complete prototype, integrated in our own Publish/Subscribe middleware called SONAR. In this paper we report the first results of using the prototype as compared to using the low level programming tools provided with the hardware. We measure a small increase in both resource consumption and processing overhead suggesting that this data-layer can be used effectively in WSN, even in cases where nodes have very limited hardware resources.},

The distribution of operators to individual nodes demands system level capabilities not available in current sensor node operating systems.

abstract={The wireless sensor network (WSN) is an interesting area for modern day research groups. Tiny sensor nodes are deployed in a diversity of environments but with limited resources. Scarce resources compel researchers to employ an operating system that requires limited memory and minimum power. Tiny operating system (TinyOS) is a widely used operating system for sensor nodes, which provides concurrency and flexibility while adhering to the constraints of scarce resources. Comparatively, TinyOS is considered to be the most robust, innovative, energy-efficient, and widely used operating system in sensor networks. This paper looks at the state-of-the-art TinyOS and the different dimensions of its design paradigm, programming model, execution model, scheduling algorithms, concurrency, memory management, hardware support platforms, and other features. The addition of different features in TinyOS makes it the operating system of choice for WSNs. Sensing nodes with TinyOS seem to show more flexibility in supporting diverse types of sensing applications.},

title={A UAV path planning with parallel ACO algorithm on CUDA platform}, 
year={2014}, 
pages={347-354}, 
abstract={Solving the path planning problem of a UAV is a challenging issue especially if there are too many checkpoints to visit. Mainly, the brute force approach is used to find the shortest path in the mission area, which requires too many times to find a solution. Therefore, evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence techniques are used to find a feasible solution in an acceptable time. In this study, path planning problem of a UAV is solved by using a highly parallelized Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm on CUDA platform. The UAV path is constructed for disseminating keys and collecting data from a Wireless Sensor Network, which is previously defined. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ACO is selected as a path planning algorithm. However, ACO is not satisfactory if the mission area becomes large and there are an excessive number of checkpoints and/or additional constraints. In order to increase the performance, some parallelization techniques must be used in high performance computing platforms. GPU architecture has emerged as a powerful and low cost architecture for enabling impressive speedups for scientific calculations. Therefore, the parallel structure is constructed on CUDA architecture. The experimental results are compared with the CPU performance of the serial algorithm, and they clearly show that the proposed approach have a great potential for acceleration of ACO and allow to solve many complex tasks such as UAV path planning problem. We also present the execution results with different parameter values to expose the results for the researchers.},

abstract={Programming wireless sensor network (WSN) applications is known to be a difficult task. Part of the problem is that the resource limitations of typical WSN nodes force programmers to use relatively low-level techniques to deal with the logical concurrency and asynchronous event handling inherent in these applications. In addition, existing general-purpose, node-level programming tools only support the networked nature of WSN applications in a limited way and result in application code that is hardly portable across different software platforms. All of this makes programming a single device a tedious and error-prone task. To address these issues we propose a high-level programming model that allows programmers to express applications as hierarchical state machines and to handle events and application concurrency in a way similar to imperative synchronous languages. Our program execution model is based on static scheduling what allows for standalone application analysis and testing. For deployment, the resulting programs are translated into efficient sequential C code. A prototype compiler for TinyOS has been implemented and its evaluation in described in this paper.},

year={2017}, 
pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Indoor temperature monitoring using wireless sensor networks is critical in many applications. For example, in data centers, it is important to monitor if the indoor temperature is within certain range so that the computers can function with near-optimal performance. In contrast to existing research that often separates the sensor network design and the measured temperature, this paper proposes a cyber-physical design approach to monitor the indoor temperature using wireless sensor networks. The source sensor wakes up and senses the temperature periodically using sleep#x002F;wake duty cycles and sends the data to the destination via multi-hop relaying nodes in an anycast way. Moreover, the period of sleep#x002F;wake duty cycle is dynamically adjusted based on the sensed temperature: when the measured temperature is normal, the sensor nodes wake up infrequently for better energy efficiency; as the sensed temperature approaches a pre-determined threshold, the sensor nodes wake up more frequently to avoid any delayed alarm trigger. The proposed design is implemented using TelosB with TinyOS, and experiments confirm that the cyber-physical system reports the alarm with a very small delay while achieving high long-term energy efficiency.},
