1) Install latex diff.

For Windows follow the instructions at https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Using_Latexdiff_For_Marking_Changes_To_Tex_Documents

1.1 install Perl: download from here; http://www.perl.org/get.html. ActivePerl
1.2 download latexdiff from CTAN; http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff
1.3 unzip the latexdiff files and copy them to the Perl > bin folder 

Ensure that the perl/bin folder is added to the PATH.

2) Create a working folder (this one)


3) Create 2 complete single document versions of the versions to be compared. 

e.g. in Coroutines-SMS-38-TECS.tex replace the following line:
  \input{Coroutines-SMS-38}
by the content of all of Coroutines-SMS-38.tex. 

Rename the new file to be Coroutines-SMS-38-combined.tex.

4) Copy resources

Copy the images folder to a new subfolder of the working folder. 
Copy the bibtex file SMS-Coro.bib to the working folder. 

5) Run the command line:

  latexdiff Coroutines-SMS-37-combined.tex Coroutines-SMS-39-combined.tex > 37-39-diff-combined.tex --exclude-textcmd="section,subsection,title"

The excluded commands are ones which cannot accept \DIF... as sub-components.

6) Build the output.

Open 37-38-diff-combined.tex in TexStudio and build.
